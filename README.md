# Personal Material

Forked from bhargavvader. Contains very nice demonstrations of topic analysis using **gensim** and **SpaCy**.

Contains personal material which is to share - Google Summer of Code proposals, Jupyter notebooks I have helped contribute to in the past, and new notebooks/code snippets I have been working on.
